In this repo, I will be sharing the links of the writeups I found on the web according to particular vulnerablities.
This repo will contains folders by vulnerability names, and inside that folder there will be a text file containing all links I ever encountered om web for that particular vulnerability type.
At First , I am gonna share XSS  writeups lists, automated tools info, BUG POCs Links, payloads I used, and other infosec guys shared on the web with the full credits to them.
